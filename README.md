## Features: 
   * Random Number Generation: The app randomly selects a number based on user input, offering an interactive way to generate random values.
   * Sleek Design: The modern, vibrant design uses custom fonts and a responsive layout for a smooth user experience across devices.
   * Real-Time Interactivity: The page instantly displays the generated number, providing immediate feedback to the user.
   * Efficient Workflow: With Grunt automation, the project streamlines tasks like compiling LESS, optimizing files, and cleaning up the build for production.
   * LESS Compilation: Converts .less files to .css for development and production.
   * File Watching: Watches for changes in .less files and HTML files to rebuild the project.
   * File Minification: Minifies JavaScript and HTML files for production.
   * CSS/JS Replacement: Replaces paths in the HTML file for development and production environments.
